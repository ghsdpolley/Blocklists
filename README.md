# Destination_Lists (formerly Blocklists)

Compilation of ad/tracking, malicious, etc. domains I have curated from open source data and my own network logging.  Sharing not only for ease of access across my devices, but to benefit anyone who may stumble onto the repo.  Adding lists by app/device for now; may build a master list later or duplicate for usage in hosts files.  Welcome to copy or use at your own risk.  Will likely improve documentation notes in the future.
